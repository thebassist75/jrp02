<h1>Job Readiness Program,<br />
Phase 1 Syllabus</h1>
<h2><i>West Hills College and Geek Wise Academy</i></h2>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>
  Phase 1 of the Job Readiness Program is an intensive-instruction class,
  designed to further develop existing web development skills already learned in the <i>West Hills College CTE program</i>.
   Because students will have this base knowledge there won’t be a need for Geekwise to cover these topics in detail.
    However, the initial part of Phase 1 will require instructor and students to review
    <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b> to assess students’ skill and aptitude in these areas.
    Post review, students will delve further into Javascript and
    MEAN Stack. Some students may still need to be brought up to speed on the basics and we will do our best to
    accommodate.
</p>
<h3>Course Technology</h3>
<p>
  Students will be required to bring their own laptop computer. The computer must be in good working condition
   able to run the latest browser and editing software. We will primarily use the <b>Chrome</b> browser,
   <b>Git</b> <i>version control</i> and the <b>Atom</b> text editor. Student must have <ins>“Administrator”</ins> privileges in order to
   install software.
</p>
<h3>Computer Usage</h3>
<p>
  In order to stay focused, please refrain from activities that are distracting to yourself and others around you.
  Everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn in a distraction-free environment.
</p>
<h3>Class Behavior Expections</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Please respect our building. You are expected to clean up after yourself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cell phones should be on silent mode during the class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Help each other. This class is about making you better so you can make your community better.<br />
    We want to foster an environment of cooperation and assistance.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessments</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of the occasional assessments are to evaluate your general course knowledge and abilities and
  to assess the effectiveness of teaching style and provide insight into your individual comprehension of
  the subject matter.
</p>
<h3>Class Participation and Attendence</h3>
<p>
  This course moves at a fast pace and much of the learning will take place during in-class exercises
  and discussion. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, complete all assigned readings
  prior to class and be prepared to participate. Attendance will be taken and participation will be
  evaluated at each class session. Communication skills are extremely important in Web development,
  which is why your participation counts. I expect everyone to actively engage in class discussions.
  <b>Engage. Think. Talk.</b>
